This project uses text and colors sourced from https://gtacnr.net/full_rules, which is the official website for GTA CnR.

This project is meant to add some features to the rules, making them easier to navigate and find relevant commentary to clarify how they are meant to be applied,
when they are enforced etc.

This site has five main features:
(1) Notes in text
  - In the rules, you will find a small number next to the text at times. 
If you click on it, a comment will reveal itself. This comment is relevant to the rule to which it belongs.

(2) "Go to the top" button
  - A simple button that brings you to the top of the page. 
  - This button is the one on top of the navigation menu in your bottom right corner.

(3) "Toggle definitions on hover" button
 - A button that, when activated, will allow you to mouse over colored words that have definitions associated with them (see the table at the top of the site) to see the definitions without having to scroll to the top.
 - This button is the second one from the top.

(4) "View all notes" button
 - A button that will show all the notes/comments.
 - This button is the second to last one.

(5) "View index" button
 - Button that allows you to quickly jump from header to header.
 - This button is the bottom one in the navigation menu.
